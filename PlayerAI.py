#			This should inherit from BaseAI. The getMove() function, which you will need to implement, returns a number that indicates the playerâ€™s action.
#			In particular, 0 stands for "Up", 1 stands for "Down", 2 stands for "Left", and 3 stands for "Right". You need to create this file and make it as intelligent as possible.
#			You may include other files in your submission, but they will have to be included through this file.

# 1) Employ the minimax algorithm. This is a requirement. There are many viable strategies to beat the 2048-puzzle game, but in this assignment we will be practicing with the minimax algorithm.
# 2) Implement alpha-beta pruning. This is a requirement. This should speed up the search process by eliminating irrelevant branches. In this case, is there anything we can do about move ordering?
# 3) Use heuristic functions. What is the maximum height of the game tree? Unlike elementary games like tic-tac-toe, in this game it is highly impracticable to search the entire depth of the theoretical game tree.
#    To be able to cut off your search at any point, you must employ heuristic functions to allow you to assign approximate values to nodes in the tree. Remember, the time limit allowed for each move is 0.2 seconds, so you must implement a systematic way to cut off your search before time runs out.
# 4) Assign heuristic weights. You will likely want to include more than one heuristic function. In that case, you will need to assign weights associated with each individual heuristic. Deciding on an appropriate set of weights will take careful reasoning, along with careful experimentation. If you feel adventurous, you can also simply write an optimization meta-algorithm to iterate over the space of weight vectors, until you arrive at results that you are happy enough with.
