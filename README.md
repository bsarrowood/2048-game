Notes:		made for edX ColumbiaX: CSMM.101x - Artificial Intelligence (AI) - week 4, project 2
		This should inherit from BaseAI. The getMove() function, which you will need to implement, returns a number that indicates the playerâ€™s action.
		In particular, 0 stands for "Up", 1 stands for "Down", 2 stands for "Left", and 3 stands for "Right". You need to create this file and make it as intelligent as possible.
		You may include other files in your submission, but they will have to be included through this file.
